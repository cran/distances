\title{distances: Tools for distances and metrics}
\description{
The \code{distances} package provides tools for constructing, manipulating
and using distance metrics. It does not calculate the complete distance matrix
when distance metric objects are created (see \code{\link{distances}}). This
lowers memory use and can increase speed.
